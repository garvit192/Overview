## Projects

### Convex Optimization API | Python, FastAPI, CVXPY, AWS EC2
**Purpose:** REST API for solving LP/QP problems with production-ready deployment on AWS.
- Solves linear/quadratic programs with constraints and bounds.
- Modular solver engine with robust error handling.
- Dockerized for reproducible builds and deployed on AWS EC2 with CloudWatch monitoring.  
[View Code](https://github.com/garvit192/CvxViz)

### Custom Functional Programming Language | Haskell, Parsec
**Purpose:** Built from scratch with combinator-based parsing, Hindley–Milner type inference, and pattern matching.
- Integrated parsing, type checking, and runtime execution.
- Interactive REPL with commands for loading files and displaying inferred types.  
- Code available on request view [additional details](https://github.com/garvit192/CvxViz)
