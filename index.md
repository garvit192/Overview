## üíº Work Experience & Projects

### üöÄ Convex Optimization Visualizer (Project)
**Role:** Developer | **Timeline:** July 2025 ‚Äì Present  
**Tech Stack:** Python, FastAPI, cvxpy, AWS (Elastic Beanstalk, S3, CloudWatch), Docker, Streamlit 

An interactive web application to model, solve, and visualize convex optimization problems in real time. The platform bridges the gap between abstract mathematical formulations and intuitive graphical understanding.

**Key Contributions:**
- Architected FastAPI backend with API versioning, environment configuration, token-based authentication, and CORS rules
- Implemented modular solver engine using `cvxpy` for LPs, QPs, and constrained optimization
- Developed interactive visualizations for optimization geometry, solver convergence, and sensitivity analysis
- Built secure, production-ready backend containerized with Docker and deployed on AWS
- Integrated AWS S3 for persistent storage and CloudWatch for monitoring

### üõ† Custom Programming Language (Project)
**Role:** Creator | **Timeline:** May 2025 - June 2025
**Tech Stack:** Haskell, Parsec

Designed and implemented a lightweight functional programming language from scratch, using Haskell with parser, evaluation engine, type checker, and REPL. Due to academic policy, source code is available upon request but cannot be published publicly.

**Key Contributions:**
- Designed and implemented the parser (grammar, AST generation, operator precedence).
- Contributed to the Eval engine for AST traversal and execution logic.
- Collaborated on integration between parser, type checker, and REPL.
